# MineBackup - Minecraft Archive Backup Program

MineBackup is a user-friendly application designed to help you easily back up, restore, and export your game save files. It's based on another copy of my open source code **Folder-High-Compression-Backup**. And you can simply run this program using Dev-C++

## Features

- **Backup**: Securely backup your game saves with just a click.
- **Restore**: Quickly restore your game saves to a previous state from either a `.7z` file or directly from the machine.
- **High-Compression**: Use 7-Zip to compress your archive and save storage space on your computer.
- **Custom Backup Path**: Set a custom path for your backups according to your storage preferences.
- **One More Thing**: A wide range of backup options and methods are waiting for you to explore

## Installation

1. **Download**: Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/Leafuke/MineBackup/releases) and download the single file for Windows.
2. **Double click**: That's ALL. No need to install.
