# MineBackup - Minecraft Archive Backup Program
It's based on another copy of my open source code **Folder-High-Compression-Backup**.


I will optimize the FHCB first and then develop this program.


1. Improve the code of FHCB and make it close to the needs of this program.
2. Move a slightly modified version of the FHCB here.
3. Add new functions for MC needs: 1. Regular backup 2. More available settings etc.
4. Implement on-game backup.
5. Multi-language adaptation.
6. Graphical interface
