# MineBackup - Minecraft Archive Backup Program

MineBackup is a user-friendly application designed to help you easily back up, restore, and export your game save files. It's based on another copy of my open source code **Folder Highly Compressed Backup** , which means it works with almost any version of Minecraft! And you can simply run this program even using Dev-C++.

## 📸Features

- **Backup**: Securely backup your game saves with just a click.
- **Restore**: Quickly restore your game saves to a previous state from either a `.7z` file or directly from your computer.
- **High-Compression**: Use 7-Zip to compress your archive and save storage space on your computer.
- **Intelligent**: You can save space by backing up only the changes.
- **Custom Backup Path**: Set a custom path for your backups according to your storage preferences.
- **Multilanguage**: We have supported two languages by now, but they can be more with your help!
- **One More Thing**: A wide range of backup options and methods are waiting for you to explore.
