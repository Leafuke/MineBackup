IMPORTANT NOTICE

2026.2.23

Starting from version 1.4.0, the overall user experience of the second-generation archive time machine FolderRewind has surpassed MineBackup. In future versions, Windows will prioritize the development and optimization of FolderRewind's features. 
If you are currently using MineBackup, it is recommended to migrate to FolderRewind as soon as possible for a better experience. 
If you choose to continue using MineBackup, that's fine too. MineBackup will continue to be maintained and updated in the foreseeable future.

The second-generation archive time machine can be directly downloaded from the Microsoft Store by searching for "FolderRewind" or by downloading the offline installer package.
